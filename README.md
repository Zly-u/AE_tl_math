The plugin uses Exprtk by Arash Partow

https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk

The plugin uses JSON for Modern C++

https://nlohmann.github.io/json/


An After Effect plugin project.
The user can write math expression for each pixels and by channels (RGBA) or GLSL Shaders.
In math expression mode, whatever your Color Space, the expected values are between 0 and 1.


Verion note:

# Alpha 05 (v 1.13)

-New GLSL engine (for fragment shaders and based on OpenGL 3.2)

-support 32bits render

-Faster exprtk render

# Alpha 04 (V1.12)

-new slider values range

-the preset has a name defined in thr script and now visible in the AE UI

-full json gateway from script to plugin

 Alpha 03 (v 1.11)
 
 -new script UI
 
 -new topics 
 
 -interaction with an other layer it's now possible (in topic input)
 
 
# Alpha 02 (v 1.1)
 
 -the plugin works with After Effect CC and above.
 
 -the plugin works in 8 and 16 bits (32bits coming soon) 
 
 -Possibilities to write an expression per channels
 
 -the plugin expressions can access to 4 sliders, two points and two colors pipets to comunicate with other AE elements.
 
 -presets can be saved as json files.
 
 -The expression language is based on Exprtk grammar  https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk

**1-HOW TO INSTALL**

on Windows : C:\Program Files\Adobe\Common\Plug-ins\7.0\MediaCore\tl

 
**2-GLSL**
**2-1 GLSL SPECIFICATIONS**

The GLSL engine is based on opengL 3.3. You can see the specification :  https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.3.30.pdf

The plugin is tested on few graphic cards but it may works on graphic card from 2011 and newer. (it works on an intel igpu 620 !)

For now (version 1.13) the plugin edits only fragment Shaders. 


Note: For the output  **out vec4 colourOut** works fine on Mac and Windows but gl_frag_Color works only on windows. (version 1.13).


**2-2 SOME WEBSITE EXEMPLES**

-www.shadertoy.com is the biggest website with exemples. But using it's code in the plugin requiere some adaptations.
   -The website uses uniform input  like iTime, iResolution that the plugins has. But  the plugin is limited to 2 textures: the layer source and one external layer.
   
www.glslsandbox.com  Most of the glsl exemples can be copy past to the plugin but don't forget to keep #version 330 at the beginning of the code

**3- MATH EXPRESSIONS**

**3-1 BASIC EXEMPLE**

-Apply the effect on a White Solid

-In the Effect UI click on "Math Expression"

-For the Alpha Channle write: xL/layerWidth

  The result is a ramp, black on the left white on the right. 
   for every pixel, the plugin devide the x coordonate by the total layerWidth of the layer.
   
   
**3-2 GRAMMAR RULES**

 3.2.1-The result
 Whatever the color Dpeth of your project (8/16 or 32 bits) with the plugin you have to think in float beween 0 and 1, like in 32 bits.  The plugin convert the result to the good depth of the project after the calculation.
 
 3.2.2-define a variable.
 Like in the After EFfect expression you can define a variable. It's compulsory to call var before to define a new one or you will get an error.
 
```
var foo := in_red*xL/layerWidth;
```
3.2.3-Sign Equal
The expression Math is based on Exprtk grammar. That's why equal is written like this 
```
:=
```
Note : the plugin will correct your if you write " = " (with spaces before and after). But when you will reopen the expression it will be changed in  " := "

3.2.4 close your "phrase"
```
;
```
As in javascript, don't forget to close the end of your phrase with  ";"

3.2.5 operators
  Math Operators are similar to operators used in the the Internal Expression system of After Effect.
  
  
NAME| DESCRIPTION|EXEMPLE|
---------|--------|--------|
`+`      |  addition| var foo:= a+b;|
`-`      | substraction|  var foo:= a-b;|
`*`  | multiply|var foo:= a*b;  |
`/`  | devide|var foo:= a/b;    |

 Boolean Operators
 Logical operators have differents name than in internal expression system but they do the same things
 
 
 NAME| DESCRIPTION|EXEMPLE|
---------|--------|--------|
`and` '&'       |  logical and. Returns true if a and b are true | a and b; a&b;|
`or`  | logical or. Returns true if a or b is true  |  a or b; |
`nand`  | logical NAND Returns true if a and b are false | a nand b;|
`nor`| logical NOR Returns true if a or b is false | a nor b;|

3.2.6 LOOPS AND CONDITIONS


3.2.6.1 IF/ELSE

```
if (a < b)
  {1}
else if (a==b) 
 {0.5}
else
  {0}  
```

3.2.6.2 LOOPS 

Loops are similar to those like in js. you can use loops for, while, switch.  Be careful, if you write a big loop, the effect will calculate it for each pixels, o limit the range of the loop or take a coffee during render time.

exemple with a loop, a condition and a break: 
```
var a :=0;
for (far i:=0; i<10; i +=1){
   if (layerHeight/yL >i)
      {
          a:=i;
          break;
      }
}
```

Note the plugin converts "&&" and "||" to the exprtk grammar.
